| Spec | Input | Output | Why |
| :-------------     | :------------- | :------------- | :----------- |
| **Program returns master string to user** | "programmingisfun" to "programmingisfun" | true | It is important to see if the base parameters are being returns correctly. |
| **Program returns a user inputted word to user.** | "fun" to "fun" | true | It is important to see if the base parameters are being returns correctly. |
| **Program checks to see if a single inputted word matches the mater string when the word and master match exactly** | "tissue" to "tissue" | true | Starts with a simple direct comparison. |
| **Program checks returns the count of how many times a word appears in the master string(not same length)** | "an" to "banana" | 2 | Adds some complexity to an otherwise direct comparison. |
| **Program returns a int for how many times a word is repeated in the master word for each element of the list** | "an" to "banana" && "na" to "banana" | 2 && 2 | Repeats the previous spec for a certain amount of times. |
